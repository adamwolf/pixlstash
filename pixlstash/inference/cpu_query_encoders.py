    torch crashes when two threads use Apple Metal at once, so only the task
    runner's GPU worker may (``docs/apple-metal-thread-safety.md``). A search
    runs on a request thread, so on Metal it encodes its query with these
    copies instead of the engine's own services and never touches Metal. The
    engine's services still compute the stored vectors, on Metal, in GPU
    tasks.

    The copies are instances of the engine's own service classes on the
    ``cpu`` device: the same model names, weights, preprocessing, normalisation
    and float32 dtype, so a query vector is comparable with the stored ones.
    Stands in for the engine in :class:`TextEmbeddingWorkflow` and
    :class:`ClipEmbeddingWorkflow`, which read only :attr:`device` and the two
    services.

    Nothing here loads a model on its own. :meth:`load` runs on the GPU
    worker, queued by the Vault, and a caller hands the copies to a search only
    once :meth:`is_loaded` is true. The idle unload does not reach them, so
    once loaded they stay loaded until the engine is released.
