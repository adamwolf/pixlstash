#: Words that make an "out of memory" message a *device* one. Without one of

#: (SQLITE_NOMEM) says it too, and treating that as transient GPU pressure
#: would retry a task that has nothing to do with the GPU.
_DEVICE_WORDS = ("cuda", "gpu", "hip", "vram")

#: Metal's OOM reads ``MPS backend out of memory`` and carries none of the words

#: keeps "clamps" and "timestamps" from reading as a device.

#: What a CUDA fault says: ``CUDA error:`` from the runtime (cuBLAS statuses and
#: "no kernel image" arrive inside it), ``CUDA driver`` and ``CUDA unknown
#: error`` from the driver and device enumeration, and cuDNN's ``cuDNN error:``,
#: version mismatch and frontend errors. When no convolution algorithm or engine
#: fits, usually for want of workspace memory, cuDNN says so without the word
#: "error", and the CPU can still run the pass. ``cudnn`` alone is not enough:
#: torch's argument checks name the cuDNN op a misplaced or mistyped tensor
#: reached ("... while checking arguments for cudnn_batch_norm"), and a bug must
#: raise, not move to the CPU.

#: What a Metal fault says besides its OOM: ``Invalid buffer size`` for one
#: allocation larger than the device's maximum buffer, and the MPS backend's
#: other size limits (matmul output, channels, graph dims); an operator or an
#: input shape it does not implement; float64, which Metal cannot represent,
#: and the dtypes and dtype combinations it cannot run. The buffer refusal is
#: not an out-of-memory condition and is_vram_oom does not read it: the same
#: allocation is refused the same way on every attempt, so only the CPU, which
#: has no such limit, can run it. The rest are capability gaps rather than
#: failures; the CPU can run what Metal cannot, so they retry there as well.
#: The phrases are torch's own and deliberately narrower than "MPS does not
#: support": "MPS device does not support linear for non-float inputs" is a
#: tensor the CPU would refuse too, and a bug must raise, not move to the CPU.
