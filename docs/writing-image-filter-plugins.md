# Writing an image filter plugin

PixlStash loads user-supplied image transforms from a folder on your machine. A plugin
takes PIL images in and gives PIL images back — a filter, a resize, an upscale, a
watermark, a caption-conditioned overlay, anything — and its outputs are imported as new
pictures beside the originals.

Start from `pixlstash/image_plugins/built-in/plugin_template.py`; this document is the
contract behind it. Its sibling is `docs/writing-tagger-plugins.md`, for plugins that
*describe* a picture rather than transform it. **The two systems are deliberately similar
but not identical, and §10 lists every place they differ** — read it if you have written
a tagger plugin already, because three of the differences will bite you.

## 1. Where plugins live

| OS | Folder |
|----|--------|
| Linux | `~/.local/share/pixlstash/image-plugins/user/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/pixlstash/image-plugins/user/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pixlstash\pixlstash\image-plugins\user\` |

(The doubled `pixlstash` on Windows is `platformdirs` inserting the app author, which
defaults to the app name. It is not a typo.)

**The folder does not exist until you create it, and a folder in the wrong place is
skipped in silence.** The path is logged at start-up.

`pixlstash-cli plugins install ./my_filter.py` works out the folder and the filename for
you, and refuses the shapes that fail silently; `plugins list` and `plugins remove` are
its siblings. Copying the file in by hand still works and is what the command does.

**Only single `.py` files are loaded.** Unlike tagger plugins, a folder with an
`__init__.py` is *not* scanned, so a plugin that wants helper modules has to inline them
or install them as a normal importable package.

**Discovery re-runs on every call.** The registry reloads before listing plugins and
before every run, so an edited file takes effect the next time the plugin menu opens —
no restart. That is the one place the image system is friendlier than the tagger one, and
it is possible only because image plugins hold no model.

A file named `plugin_template.py` is skipped by name, so the shipped template can sit in
the folder without registering.

Plugin code runs unsandboxed, in the server process, with your permissions. Only install
plugins you trust.

## 2. The minimum plugin

Subclass `ImagePlugin` and implement `parameter_schema()` and `run()`.

```python
from typing import Any

from PIL import Image

from pixlstash.image_plugins.base import ImagePlugin


class MyFilter(ImagePlugin):
    name = "my_filter"                 # unique snake_case id
    display_name = "My Filter"         # label in the menus
    description = "What it does."      # shown above the parameters
    author = "Your Name <you@example.com>"   # email address or URL
    license = "MIT"                    # your own code, SPDX where there is one
    models = []                        # every model or service you load
    supports_images = True             # offered for still images
    supports_videos = False            # ...and/or video files, via run_video

    def parameter_schema(self) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        return []

    def run(self, images, parameters=None, progress_callback=None,
            error_callback=None, captions=None) -> list[Image.Image]:
        return [image.copy() for image in images]
```

`name` must be non-empty. **A user plugin whose name matches a built-in replaces the
built-in**, because the user folder is scanned first and the first registration of a name
wins. This is the opposite of the tagger system, where the built-in wins — so naming a
plugin `rotate`, `scaling`, `pixelate`, `blur_sharpen`, `colour_filter` or
`brightness_contrast` takes over that menu entry rather than being rejected. The server
log says so, naming *your* file as the one replacing the built-in, and that log line is
the only place you will see it — the registry also records it as a load error, but that
list is served nowhere (§9). `pixlstash-cli plugins list` marks such a file
`(replaces the built-in)` without loading anything, which is the easier place to check.

**Only one `ImagePlugin` subclass per file is registered** — the first *concrete* one the
file itself defines. A subclass you merely `import` at the top of your file is skipped
(it belongs to whoever defined it), and so is an abstract intermediate base you put above
your real class. A file that defines two concrete plugins still registers only the first;
give each plugin its own file.

`supports_images` and `supports_videos` decide where the plugin is offered: the grid
context menu, the selection bar and the overlay each hide a plugin that does not claim the
media type currently selected. A plugin with `supports_videos = False` is simply absent
when a video is selected, rather than failing when run.

## 3. `parameter_schema()` — this JSON *is* the settings UI

Return a list of parameter definitions. `PluginParametersUI.vue` builds the form straight
from it, so there is nothing else to write for the UI. Values arrive back in `run()` as
the `parameters` dict, keyed by `name`, and they are **not** type-checked — read them
defensively.

Required keys: `name` (snake_case), `label`, `type`, `default`. Optional: `description`
(help text under the field).

| `type` | Control |
|--------|---------|
| `number` / `integer` | Numeric input |
| `boolean` | Checkbox |
| `string` | Single-line text field — **or a dropdown, when `enum` is present** |

**A dropdown is `type: "string"` plus an `enum` list**, optionally with an `enumLabels`
map from value to display text:

```python
{
    "name": "algorithm",
    "label": "Algorithm",
    "type": "string",
    "default": "lanczos",
    "enum": ["bicubic", "bilinear", "lanczos", "nearest_neighbour"],
    "enumLabels": {"nearest_neighbour": "Nearest neighbour"},
    "description": "Interpolation algorithm used during scaling.",
}
```

`ImagePlugin.parameter_schema`'s own docstring and the shipped template both describe a
`"select"` type with an `"options"` key. **That form is not rendered as a dropdown** — the
UI has no `select` branch, so such a field falls through to a free-text input. Every
built-in uses `string` + `enum`; follow the built-ins, not the docstring. (Tagger plugins
*do* have a real `select` type with `options`. The two schemas are not the same schema.)

`base.py` gives you `_coerce_number` and `_coerce_positive_number` for reading numeric
parameters back safely.

## 4. `run()` — the transform

```python
def run(self, images, parameters=None, progress_callback=None,
        error_callback=None, captions=None) -> list[Image.Image]:
```

- `images` are PIL images, already EXIF-oriented (`ImageOps.exif_transpose`) and
  **converted to RGB** — there is no alpha channel on the way in, whatever the source
  file had.
- **The returned list must be the same length as `images`, in the same order.** A
  mismatch raises and the whole run fails, so on a per-image failure append a fallback
  (usually `image.copy()`) and report the error rather than dropping the entry.
- `captions` is one string per image — the picture's stored description, or `""` — so a
  transform can be caption-conditioned. The caller may override it, but you should treat
  it as "the text for this image".
- Return a **different size** freely; nothing downstream assumes the output matches the
  input.

Report progress and failures through the two helpers rather than by hand, so the payload
shape stays consistent — they become `PLUGIN_PROGRESS` WebSocket events that drive the
progress UI:

```python
self.report_progress(progress_callback, current=idx + 1, total=total,
                     message="Processed")
self.report_error(error_callback, index=idx, message="Failed",
                  details={"error": str(exc)})
```

Both are no-ops when the callback is `None`, so they are always safe to call.

`run()` and `run_video()` may block; they must not assume an event loop. Where they run
depends on the inference device:

- **CUDA and the CPU:** on a worker thread (`asyncio.to_thread`).
- **Apple Metal:** on the task runner's single GPU worker thread, the one thread allowed
  to use Metal, because torch crashes when two threads use it at once
  (`docs/apple-metal-thread-safety.md`). The call is queued at `URGENT` priority, so it
  waits for the GPU task already running (a caption batch, say) and then runs, with no
  timeout. The progress and error callbacks are called on that thread too. PixlStash
  cannot tell whether a plugin uses the GPU, so this holds for every plugin: on Metal a
  plain PIL filter waits behind GPU work as well, and while a long run holds the worker,
  searches that need it can answer 503. Do not start threads of your own that use torch
  on Metal; do all device work inside `run()` / `run_video()`.

## 5. Video

Set `supports_videos = True` and override `run_video(source_path, parameters, ...)`. It
receives a **path**, not frames, and returns either encoded `bytes` or a `(bytes,
extension)` tuple.

Do not write the decode/encode loop. `base.py` has it:

```python
def run_video(self, source_path, parameters=None, progress_callback=None,
              error_callback=None):
    strength = self._coerce_number((parameters or {}).get("strength"), 1.0)
    return self.transform_video(
        source_path,
        lambda frame: self._apply(frame, strength),
        progress_callback=progress_callback,
        error_callback=error_callback,
        error_message="Failed to process video",
        progress_verb="Blurred",
    )
```

`transform_video` opens the source, runs your per-frame callable over RGB PIL frames,
sizes the writer **from the first transformed frame** (so a transform that changes the
frame size needs no arithmetic of its own), tries several container/codec pairs until one
opens, keeps a `.webm` source in its own container where it can, reports per-frame
progress, and cleans up its temporary file. Your callable must return the same size for
every frame — OpenCV silently drops writes that disagree with the writer.

A video source reaching a plugin that only sets `supports_videos = True` without
overriding `run_video` falls back to the still-image path on the extracted frame, rather
than failing.

## 6. What happens to your output

Outputs are imported as new pictures, not written over the source. Per output:

- **Format follows the source** — a JPEG in, a JPEG out — unless you returned
  `(bytes, ".ext")`, which is taken as-is.
- **Placed in the source's stack** by default; the caller can pass `stack=false` to skip
  the stack placement while keeping every association below.
- **Set and project memberships are copied** from the source.
- **Faces are re-detected, never copied.** The output is given a `source_picture_id`, and
  the normal finders extract its real faces and inherit a character from the source only
  where the two faces actually match. This is why `get_bbox_transform()` exists and does
  nothing: see §9.
- A picture living in a **reference folder** has its output written next to it, inheriting
  the folder and the source's base file name.

## 7. Dependencies

`PIL`, `numpy` and `cv2` are already imported by the host, so use them freely. Anything
else must be installed into the same environment PixlStash runs in — there is no
per-plugin dependency manifest and no isolation. An `ImportError` at module scope is
caught and recorded as a load error rather than taking the server down, but the plugin
will simply be absent.

## 8. Licensing

`pixlstash/image_plugins/base.py` and the template are MIT-licensed carve-outs (see
`docs/licensing.md`) precisely so plugins can be authored under any license. The only
import a plugin should take from PixlStash is
`from pixlstash.image_plugins.base import ImagePlugin`. Anything deeper is not a contract.

**Say which license, in the class.** `author`, `license` and `models` default to `""`,
`""` and `[]`, so a plugin that omits them still loads and a caller simply shows nothing
for it — but they are how anyone finds out what they are about to run before they run it.
`models` lists every model or remote service the plugin loads, each entry a
`{"name": ..., "license": ...}` dict, because *your* license says nothing about the weights
you download; the built-in filters load none and declare `[]`. Keep all three as plain
literals — they are meant to be read off the source with `ast`, without importing the
module, so a computed value reads as absent.

## 9. Known limitations

Honest gaps, not things to design around:

- **A load error is not shown anywhere in the UI.** The registry records the file and the
  message, but `GET /pictures/plugins` deliberately no longer returns them: an error row
  carries the absolute path of the failing plugin, and that route is reachable by any
  token. **The server log is the only place a broken image plugin is reported.** (The
  tagger system moved its errors onto a local-owner-only route instead; doing the same
  here is worth an issue.)
- **`get_bbox_transform()` is never called.** Its only caller was the face-copy step,
  which was removed because copying a bbox through a transform assumed the output still
  contained the face. Implementing it has no effect today; `scaling` and `rotate` still
  do, and the contract is kept in case bbox mapping is needed again.
- **There is no cancellation.** No stop event is passed, and a long `run()` cannot be
  interrupted. Keep an eye on batch size.
- **There is no VRAM accounting.** Nothing asks an image plugin what it will use before
  scheduling it, so a GPU upscaler competes with the captioner and the face models on
  trust alone.
- **There is no download lifecycle.** Unlike tagger plugins there is no
  `needs_download()`/`download()` pair and no download button; a plugin that needs weights
  has to fetch them itself, on first use, without a UI.

## 10. Differences from tagger plugins

If you have written one of the other kind, these are the ones that will catch you out —
the first three go no further than the server log, which is why they are first.

| | Image filter plugins | Tagger / captioner plugins |
|---|---|---|
| **Name collision** | **User plugin wins**, replacing the built-in; logged against the user file | **Built-in wins**; the user plugin is rejected and listed as an error |
| **Classes per file** | **Only the first** concrete `ImagePlugin` subclass the file *defines* | **Every** concrete class the module *defines* |
| **Load errors** | Server log only | Listed in Settings → Auto-tagging (local owner only) |
| Plugin shape | Single `.py` file | Single `.py` file **or** a package folder with `__init__.py` |
| Reload | Re-scanned on every list and every run | Start-up only; a restart is required |
| Dropdown parameter | `type: "string"` + `enum` (+ `enumLabels`) | `type: "select"` + `options` as `[{value, label}]` |
| Parameter types | `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `string` | those plus `select`, `textarea`, `csv-int` |
| Model lifecycle | None — no `init`, no `unload`, no download hooks | `setup`/`init`/`unload`/`is_loaded` + a download pair |
| Base class | `ImagePlugin` (`pixlstash/image_plugins/base.py`) | `TaggerPlugin` (`pixlstash/tagger_plugins/base.py`) |
| Folder | `…/pixlstash/image-plugins/user/` | `…/pixlstash/tagger-plugins/user/` |

Both are MIT-licensed base classes, both run unsandboxed in the server process, and
neither has any dependency isolation.
